            <h2>Our History</h2>
            <p>Campanella Pizza began its journey in 2014 as a small family dream to bring authentic Italian-style pizza to the heart of Meyerton. What started as a passion for traditional wood-fired cooking has grown into a beloved local establishment that serves the community with pride.</p>
            
            <p>Our founders recognised that Meyerton needed a place where families could gather over genuinely delicious, freshly made pizza. They invested in a traditional wood-fired oven and committed to using only the finest locally sourced ingredients to create something special.</p>
            
            <p>Over the years, we have become more than just a pizzeria. We are a cornerstone of the community, where neighbors become friends and every meal is prepared with love and attention to detail.</p>
