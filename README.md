# Campanella Pizza Website

**By ST10433587**

## Project Overview

This project involves the development of a comprehensive website for Campanella Pizza, a family-owned pizzeria located in Meyerton, South Africa. The website serves as the digital presence for this local business that has been serving the community since 2014, specialising in authentic wood-fired pizzas.

The Campanella Pizza website development project spans 12 weeks from 21 July 2025 to 14 October 2025. This structured approach divides the work into three distinct phases, each building upon the previous foundation to create a comprehensive online presence for the restaurant.

The development of this website addresses the current lack of online presence for Campanella Pizza. Through direct interviews conducted with the owners and staff on 26 July 2025, comprehensive insights were gathered regarding business operations, customer needs, and website requirements. This information serves as the foundation for creating a digital platform that accurately represents the restaurant's values and offerings.

The website showcases Campanella Pizza's commitment to delivering authentic, high-quality pizza made with locally sourced ingredients, while providing exceptional service in a warm and welcoming environment. The digital platform reflects the restaurant's mission to become Meyerton's most loved local pizzeria through excellence in food and service.

## Website Goals and Objectives

### Primary Goals

The website has been designed to achieve several key business objectives:

- **Menu Accessibility**: Customers can view the complete menu online, providing convenient access to all available pizzas, drinks, and extras without needing to visit the physical location or make phone calls for information.

- **Online Ordering Capability**: The platform enables customers to place orders directly through the website, streamlining the ordering process and reducing phone-based transactions.

- **Enhanced Visibility**: The website increases brand awareness and online presence, making Campanella Pizza more discoverable to potential customers in Meyerton and surrounding areas.

- **Promotional Platform**: Special offers, events, and promotional deals are prominently featured to drive sales and customer engagement.

- **Customer Relationship Building**: Newsletter subscription functionality allows the restaurant to maintain ongoing communication with customers, building loyalty and encouraging repeat business.

### Key Performance Indicators

The success of the website will be measured through several metrics:

- Monthly website traffic to gauge overall reach and engagement
- Number of online orders placed through the platform
- Click-through rates on promotional banners to assess marketing effectiveness
- Newsletter subscription numbers to measure customer loyalty building
- Bounce rate analysis to evaluate user engagement and content relevance

## Target Audience

The website specifically caters to:

- Local families and individuals residing in Meyerton
- Students and young adults seeking convenient food options
- Pizza enthusiasts within a 20-kilometre radius of the restaurant
- Community members looking for authentic Italian-style dining experiences

## Key Features and Functionality

**User Experience Optimisation**: The design prioritises simplicity and efficiency, allowing visitors to access menu information and place orders with minimal clicks whilst maintaining high contrast for readability and consistent visual branding throughout all pages.

## Technical Implementation

The website utilises modern web technologies, including HTML5 for semantic structure, CSS for visual styling and responsive design, and JavaScript for interactive functionality. The responsive framework ensures compatibility across all devices and screen sizes.

Hosting is provided through Afrihost with the domain www.campanellapizza.co.za, ensuring reliable South African-based service. The technical architecture supports future scalability and maintenance requirements.

## Content Strategy

All website content has been developed through primary research, including direct interviews with restaurant owners and staff. Visual elements utilise legally sourced stock photography from FreePik, professional typography from Google Fonts, and carefully selected colour schemes from ColorHunt that reflect the authentic Italian dining experience.

The content strategy emphasises local relevance whilst maintaining professional presentation standards that build customer trust and encourage online ordering behaviour.

## Development Timeline

### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-5)

**Duration**: 21 July - 25 August 2025

The initial phase focuses on establishing the groundwork for the entire project. During the first week, the team conducts thorough research into the organisation's needs and submits the project proposal whilst setting up the GitHub repository. Week two involves detailed content planning, including finalising the sitemap design and creating wireframes for all pages. The third and fourth weeks concentrate on HTML development, building the structural foundation for all five pages using semantic HTML tags and implementing a functional navigation system. The final week of this phase involves comprehensive testing, validation, and preparation for the first submission deadline on 27 August 2025.
